This repo includes all the projects I have done for the course known as CS50’s Web Programming with Python and JavaScript by Harvard University. 
The course consists of 5 projects and a final project. In order to complete the course successfully, all the projects need to get a valid score after graded by the course staff. Each project focuses on a specific topic on web development. Throughout the course, projects have been implemented using HTML, CSS and Javascript for the frontend and for the backend of the applications, python has been used for the main programming language with Django framework.
